# **Random Quotes**
## It’s an application that fetches a new random quote each time a button is pressed and displays it in the browser. Here’s a screenshot of what the finished application looks like:

One of the most basic uses of JavaScript is for making interactive wepbages. This allows the page to change slightly or totally when a user performs an action. JavaScript is used for just about everything these days, including, but not limited to, server infrastructure, desktop and mobile apps.

We have two buttons: the first one for fetching a new **random quote** and displaying it on the page, and second for **sharing the quote on Twitter.** At the moment, clicking on either button has no effect and that’s because we haven’t written any JavaScript code yet.

Our task is to fetch a new quote when the quote button is clicked and display it to the user. We’ll be making use of the [What Does Trump Think](https://api.whatdoestrumpthink.com/api/) **API** to accomplish this.
